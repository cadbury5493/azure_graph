AWS Inspector is marking CIS 5.2.4.6 as skipped even though it’s “automated” in docs because:

Prereqs missing – SSM Agent, Inspector plugin, or IAM role not set up right.

Platform mismatch – Control not actually implemented for Amazon Linux 2023 / your architecture.

Network issue – Instance can’t reach required AWS endpoints to run the check.
