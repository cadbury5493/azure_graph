Hi Prabhu,

Thanks for publishing the new baseline versions for Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 3.

In the intake request for RHEL8, I had requested a baseline version for 3.0.0 — could you please publish the same?

I’ve validated that the Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 3 IDs are matching; however, I noticed that the waiver data is missing in the Excel file. Could you please share the waiver data for these platforms for the AWSCENTRAL business unit?

Thanks,
