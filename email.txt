Hi HeRan,

Thanks for sharing the report. However, I was expecting a compliance report similar to the one attached. This example was shared earlier by the CRDPM team, where they had run scans that show how many controls passed for a particular platform.

If such a report isn’t available, that’s fine. What’s more important is understanding how we can get the instances compliant. Our goal is to achieve >95% compliance across all instances.

Could you please advise how we can proceed toward this goal?

Do we need to raise a support ticket for your team to investigate?

If we are already using approved baselines, why might the instances still be non-compliant?

Looking forward to your guidance on the next steps.
