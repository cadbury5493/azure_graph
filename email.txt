“I respectfully disagree with this view. While it’s reasonable for some controls from the approved baseline to fail, the current numbers are much higher than acceptable—on average 50 controls failing on Amazon Linux 2023, 80 on Amazon Linux 2, and 60 on RHEL 8. This suggests a fundamental issue that needs investigation.

I recommend we:

Verify that the correct, approved baseline images are being used.

Confirm that the controls with approved exceptions are actually being skipped as intended.

I’ve also checked with the GCS team, and granting waivers for such a large number of controls is not advisable.
For now, we should focus on remediating the basic failing controls that should be enforced by the base image—e.g., enabling features like cramfs—so that application teams don’t need to re-enable them.

Separately, GCS can evaluate whether a broader exception process that is enforceable and auditable can be defined in the future (Prabhu to explore). But our immediate priority should be investigating these failures and redeploying with corrected configurations where possible.”
