Current State (AWSCentral)

AWSCentral is currently using AWS Inspector as the compliance scanning solution for managed instances running within the AWS environment.

Issues Identified

Lack of Baseline Evidence
None of the current instances are fully compliant. To investigate further, we do not have scan evidence or baseline results from vanilla (unmodified) base images for:

Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2023

RHEL 8

Partial Compliance Despite Waivers
All managed instances are approximately 76% compliant, even after applying approved waivers (excluding waivers containing alphanumeric identifiers). This indicates additional underlying non-compliance issues.

Uncontrolled CIS Benchmark Versions
The CIS Benchmark version used by AWS Inspector changes automatically whenever CIS releases a new version. This leads to scan result variability and non-compliance drift, as these newer versions are not part of the approved baseline standards currently used by the teams.

Alternative Solution (AWSFederated)

The AWSFederated team has developed a new compliance solution using AWS Systems Manager (SSM) that addresses the limitations of AWS Inspector.

Key Features

Supports Custom CIS Profiles, which can be stored in GitHub or S3 repositories.

Runs compliance scans against AWS-managed instances using these custom profiles.

Transforms and exports the scan results into a customized format suitable for ingestion into Splunk, providing unified reporting and analytics.

Next Steps
Requests from AWSCentral

Spin up vanilla base images for:

Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2023

RHEL 8

These images should be scanned using both Qualys (by GCS) and AWS Inspector to capture baseline compliance results.
This will help determine whether remediation should occur at the base image level or be handled by individual application teams.

Requests from AWSFederated

Conduct a collaborative working session with AWSCentral to:

Align on sourcing and maintaining CIS Benchmark profiles from AWSCentral’s repositories.

Finalize the integration of these benchmarks within the AWS SSM–based compliance scanning workflow.
