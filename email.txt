Compliance Issues on Base Images – Request for Confirmation and Scan Evidence

Hi Jack,

Hope you're doing well. Thank you for spinning up the instances for Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and RHEL 8 base images.

Upon analysis, we found that both Qualys and Inspector reports are flagging the base images as failures, even after applying waivers. The identified failures have been compared against the approved baselines for verification. When we checked with the Image Bakery team, they mentioned that only the RHEL 9 images have been certified.

Could you please confirm if your team baked these images? If so, can we proceed with applying the necessary fixes on the base images, or would it be preferable to request waivers to bring these images into compliance?
Additionally, if your team has an approved version of these images, could you please share the evidence of scan results from both Qualys and Inspector?

I've attached an Excel file containing the compliance status and failing controls, along with our comparative analysis of the Qualys and Inspector scan results.

Thanks,
Sarthak
