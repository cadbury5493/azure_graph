In the security-approved configuration for Amazon Linux 2023, there is a column called “Is Control Disable.”
Could you please clarify its meaning? Specifically:

If the value is 1 for a particular control, does that indicate the control has been approved by GCS and granted a waiver?

I ask because I received a separate list of exceptions from GCS, and it does not match the rows where this column is set to 1.

If the “Is Control Disable” column is also intended to represent approved exceptions, I can reconcile the two lists and add any missing controls from the GCS list to the waiver set so these controls can be marked as skipped rather than failed.
