Hi Prabhu,

Thanks for publishing the new baseline versions for Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 3.

In the intake request for RHEL8, I had requested a baseline version for 3.0.0 â€” could you please publish the same?

Iâ€™ve validated that the Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 3 IDs are matching; however, I noticed that the waiver data is missing in the Excel file. Could you please share the waiver data for these platforms for the AWSCENTRAL business unit?

Thanks,


Subject: Waivers Data Findings for CRDPM and AWSCentral

Hi Prabhu,

Please find my findings on the deviations data provided for the below business units:

1. CRDPM

We are looking for waivers data for Amazon Linux 2023 and Windows Server 2022.

Filters applied: Business Unit = CRD, Business Unit 2 = AWS.

With these filters:

Only Amazon Linux 2023 appears in the Technology Component column. Windows Server 2022 is missing.

For Amazon Linux 2023, the Control Reference column is empty.

ðŸ‘‰ Could you please provide the data for Amazon Linux 2023 and Windows Server 2022 with CIS Benchmark v2.0.0 or v3.0.0?

2. AWSCentral

We are looking for waivers data for Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and RHEL 8.

Filters applied: Business Unit = CORP, Business Unit 2 = AWS.

With these filters:

All three platforms appear in the Technology Component column.

However, none of them specify which CIS benchmark version was used to provide waivers.

Control Reference column:

Has data for Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023.

Is empty for RHEL 8.

ðŸ‘‰ Could you please confirm which CIS Benchmark version (v2.0.0 or v3.0.0) was used for these waivers and also provide the missing Control Reference data for RHEL 8?

Thanks,
