This document provides an overview of the process used to perform compliance scans across the AWS Central platform. Because we do not have automated access to Box, this process must be completed manually every Friday after the AWS Inspector scan reports are uploaded.

Prerequisites

Box Access – Submit an access request through SailPoint.

Python Installation – Request Python access/installation through SailPoint.

Required Dependencies – Install all necessary Python libraries and dependencies.
