The following tables provide a detailed analysis of the Amazon Linux 2023 CIS profile.

Rows marked in green indicate controls where CIS profile versions align with Amazon Inspector.

The Description column includes excerpts from the CIS benchmark, JSON output from the Amazon Inspector report, and relevant snippets from the CIS InSpec code repository.

Issues Identified

CIS ID Format Mismatch

GCS generates CIS IDs with alphabet suffixes (e.g., 4.1.9b, 4.1.9c), which do not directly map to Amazon Inspector reports.

Inspector reports instead use a simplified format (e.g., 4.1.9).

Exception Handling

GCS exceptions reference alphabet-suffixed controls (e.g., 4.1.9b, 4.1.9c).

Amazon Inspector only provides the aggregated control (4.1.9).

This creates ambiguity in applying exceptions, since Inspector does not distinguish sub-controls individually.
