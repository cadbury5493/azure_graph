Below are the exception CIS IDs provided by GCS with baseline v3.0.0.
The table compares these exceptions against AWS Inspector, which currently uses v2.0.0 baselines for scanning.

✅ Green → CIS IDs and descriptions match directly between v3.0.0 (GCS) and v2.0.0 (Inspector).

🔴 Red → CIS IDs differ, but the same control with an equivalent description exists in Inspector.

❌ NA → Neither the CIS ID nor the description is available in Inspector.
