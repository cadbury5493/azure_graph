AWS Inspector skips manual controls because they can’t be evaluated programmatically; they require human review and are usually addressed via governance/compliance workflows instead.

Manual controls are things that cannot be reliably checked by an automated tool (e.g., “Verify IAM policies are reviewed quarterly” or “Ensure encryption keys are rotated as per policy”).

These controls require human judgment, process validation, or organizational context that Inspector cannot infer from AWS APIs.

Since Inspector’s scope is automated compliance validation, it intentionally skips those manual checks rather than marking them as failures or successes.
