Hi Lucy,

As per the last report you shared on the 19th:

Prod scans are generated on Sunday (14th)

Dev scans on Wednesday (17th)

UAT scans on Thursday (18th)

I checked the Box folder but don’t see any Inspector Reports for Wednesday (Dev) or Thursday (UAT), so I currently don’t have any Dev or UAT data.

I also noticed that 29 Excel files were uploaded on Sunday.
However, all 29 files are Prod results, whereas we should ideally have 29 files in total distributed as follows:

10 Prod

10 UAT

9 Dev

This indicates that the uploaded data is incomplete and inaccurate.
Could you please upload the Dev, UAT, and Prod data to Box properly and let me know once it’s done?
Without this data, we’re unable to perform this week’s scans.
