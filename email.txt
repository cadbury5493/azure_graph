Hello Team,

I am currently calculating the compliance percentage of instances in AWSCentral. The percentage is derived by checking the total number of controls against the number of passed controls.

I have also applied the waivers shared by the GCS team, but I still do not see any instances falling under the <95% compliance category.

Could you please help confirm the following:

Whether the base images we are using are already compliant?

If yes, what version of the CIS baseline are these images aligned with?

Most of our instances are running on:

Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2023

RHEL 8

Additionally, could you please share the CIS scan results of the vanilla/base images for these platforms?

This will help us validate if the compliance scores we are observing are consistent with the baseline expectations.
