Hi,

I am in the process of applying waivers for the AWSCentral Business Unit, which includes the following three platforms:

Amazon Linux 2

Amazon Linux 2023

RHEL 8

Filters Applied:

To isolate the relevant waivers, I applied the following filters:

Business Unit: Selected CORP

Business Unit 2: Selected Blank and AWS

Technology Component: Selected Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2023, and RHEL8

Observations and Clarifications Needed:
RHEL 8:

Rows 40–102:
These entries list RHEL 8, but there is no mention of the CIS benchmark version the waivers apply to.

Rows 444–469:
These also pertain to RHEL 8, but again, no CIS benchmark version is specified, and the Control ID is missing as well.

Rows 1596–1619:
These entries are for RHEL 8 and clearly specify the CIS Benchmark version (3.0.0) along with the Control References.
✅ These seem to have all the required details.

Question:
Can I consider only the waivers in rows 1596–1619 as valid and complete for RHEL 8? Please clarify whether the earlier rows (40–102 and 444–469) are usable or should be disregarded due to incomplete information.

Amazon Linux 2:

Rows 123–135:
These entries do not mention which CIS benchmark version the waivers correspond to.

Rows 658–678:
These waivers are for Amazon Linux 2, but for version 1.0.0.
We require waivers for version 3.0.0.
➤ Please confirm if waivers for Amazon Linux 2 - CIS 3.0.0 are available.

Amazon Linux 2023:

The entries for Amazon Linux 2023 do not specify a CIS Benchmark version.
However, since CIS has released only one version (1.0.0) for this platform, I am assuming the waivers provided are for CIS 1.0.0.
➤ Please confirm if this assumption is correct.

Let me know if you need any more information or clarification from my side.

Best regards,
